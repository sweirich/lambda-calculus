This repository contains a formalization of a "Graph Model" denotational semantics  
for the untyped lambda calculus.



Compilation instructions
------------------------

This development has been tested with The Coq Proof Assistant, version 8.17.0.

If you have Coq, Ott, metalib and LaTeX installed (see below), the toplevel
Makefile supports the following targets:

    `make coq`   - compile the coq development
        
    `make spec`  - use Ott to generate LaTeX definitions and then produce
                   the document [spec/lc.pdf](spec/lc.pdf)
                  
    `make gen`   - use Ott and LNgen to regenerate the two Coq files 
                   listed below.
                  
    `make clean` - remove all generated files

The command `make` triggers the `coq` and `spec` targets.

Rules Specification 
-------------------

The specification of the lambda calculus grammar and associated inductive
relations is in the Ott specification in [lc.ott](lc.ott).
The Makefile then uses this file to generate three files: 
    
- [spec/lc-rules.tex](spec/lc-rules.tex), containing LaTeX definitions
      of the system. This file is imported by [spec/lc.mng](spec/lc.mng), 
      a LaTeX file that is preprocessed by Ott to produce 
      [spec/lc.pdf](spec/lc.pdf).

- [coq/lc_ott.v](coq/lc_ott.v), containing Coq definitions of the
      inductive datatypes specified in the system, and generated by Ott's
      locally nameless backend.

- and [coq/lc_inf.v](coq/lc_inv.v), containing auxiliary Coq definitions
      (open, size, etc.)  and proofs about the substitution and free variable
      functions, generated by LNgen.
      
These generated files are included in the repository in case you would like
to work through the details without installing Ott or LNgen.

Tools installation
------------------

To compile this code with Coq, you also need to install a copy of the Metalib
library. This library is available from https://github.com/plclub/metalib.

You can install these tools via opam (https://opam.ocaml.org/): 

     opam switch create 4.11.1
     opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
     opam pin coq 8.15.0
     opam pin add coq-metalib https://github.com/plclub/metalib.git
      

To regenerate the Ott and LNgen definitions, you will need to install these
tools separately. The former is available through opam.

     opam install ott

The [LNgen tool](https://github.com/plclub/lngen) can be cloned from its
repository and built using Haskell.
