This document describes a denotational semantics for a
based on a ``graph'' model. 

\section{Part one: untyped lambda calculus}


The file \texttt{simple/model.v} contains a sketch of this semantics for the
call-by-value untyped lambda calculus.

This semantics interprets lambda calculus terms as a graph: a set of
input-output pairs, each pair written $w \mapsto v$, where $w$ and $v$
are elements of some domain $\mathcal{W}$. 

The graph semantics also includes a special term $\circ$ as part of this set,
to signal function values. See below.

\subsection{Examples}

Here are some examples.

\begin{itemize}
\item The graph of the identity function $\lambda x.x$ looks like this:

\[ \{ w \mapsto w\ |\ w \in \mathcal{W} \} \cup \{ \circ \} \]

This graph maps all inputs $w$ to $w$. 

\item If we have a nonterminating expression, like $\omega$, i.e. 
  $(\lambda x.x)(\lambda x.x)$,
  then its denotation is the emptyset.  It is not
  a value and we cannot apply it to any arguments to get a results.

   \[ \{\} \]

\item The denotation of a function that takes an argument and then diverges
  i.e. $\lambda x. \omega$ is the special term only.

  \[ \{ \circ \} \]

  The term $\circ$ marks that this is a value, but there are still no mappings
  in the graph. This term lets us distinguish the denotation of a diverging
  expression from that of a value, even if we cannot use the value.

\item The denotation of $K$, i.e. $\lambda x.\lambda y.x$ is  

  \[ \{ w_1 \mapsto \{ w_2 \mapsto w_1\ |\ w_2 \in \mathcal{W} \}\ \cup \{\circ\}\ |\ w_1 \in \mathcal{W} \} \cup \{ \circ \} \]

\noindent but we will see below that this definition could also be 

  \[ \{ w_1 \mapsto (w_2 \mapsto w_1)\ |\ w_1, w_2 \in \mathcal{W} \} \cup \{ \circ \} \]

because this set is extensionally equivalent. (SCW: need to define this equivalence).

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Representing the domain}

What is this domain $\mathcal{W}$? Informally, we would like it to be the
powerset of all mappings (plus the trivial term $\circ$):

\[ \mathcal{W} = \mathscr{P}( 
  \{ w_1 \mapsto w_2\ |\ w_1, w_2 \in \mathcal{W} \} \cup \circ )  \] 

\noindent But that is not a well founded definition. 

And how do we represent this set in a proof assistant?


We can represent the powerset of some type by its characteristic function,
i.e. a proposition that tells us whether the value is in the set.

\begin{lstlisting}{language=Coq}
Definition P (A : Type) := A -> Prop.
\end{lstlisting}

However, this definition does not give us an \emph{inductive} or finite
representation of values. For that we need to consider only finite sets of
values. (We'll use the type constructor \texttt{fset A} to refer to a finite
set containing elements of type \texttt{A}). This type can be inductively
defined and injected into the non-inductive variant \texttt{P A}. Using this
finite set type, we can build up our representation out of an inductive
representation of a mapping (\texttt{v\_map}) and trivial term (\texttt{v\_fun}): 

\codeplus{../coq/simple/model.v}{Value}{language=Coq}

And then represent lambda calculus expressions to a potentially infinite set
of these terms.

\begin{lstlisting}{mathescape,language=Coq}
Definition W := P Value.
\end{lstlisting}

As an example, let's consider the identity function. The 
semantics of this function is:

\codeplus{../coq/simple/model.v}{idset}{} 


Consider how this definition reacts with the semantic function for application:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Coq,mathescape]
Definition APPLY (D1 : P Value) (D2 : P Value) : P Value :=
  fun w $\Rightarrow$ exists V, (v_map V w $\in$ D1) $\wedge$ (mem V $\subseteq$ D2) $\wedge$ (valid_mem V).
\end{lstlisting}

Or, equally expressed as an inductive:

\codeplus{../coq/simple/model.v}{APPLY}{} 




\section{Part two: Extending the model to verse}

The files in the  \texttt{verse/} subdirectory contain the semantics of a much richer language.

\begin{itemize}
\item Verse contains multiple types of values: not only functions, but also integers and finite lists of values.
\item Because of the multiple types, there is the possibility
that the meaning of a term might be a \emph{run-time error}. For
example, if we try to apply the number 3 to itself.
\item Verse terms, if they don't produce an error, may also 
  produce multiple results, using choice.
\end{itemize}
